# Predicting Length of stay of ICU patients using MIMIC-IV data

The codes were to used to predict length of stay (LOS) of ICU patients in MIMIC-IV dataset. 

The best performing model is Multitask Fusion-CNN which was derived from Zhang's paper.
Training MAE (LOS) = 1.9 \n
Testing MAE (LOS) = 2.7

This was part of coursework assignment 2 of NUS module SPH6004: Advanced Statistical Learning.
